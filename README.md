# Klyx-Zerocycle-Setups
Here are my current modern Zerocycle Setups.
I think this new version holds up with other modern methods top-runners use and is a great alternative for sure.

Advantages of my Setups:
My setups require 2 blast resistant blocks that can be Obby or Anchors. With my setups you can reach your standing position really fast without a lot of fast-bridging, because you can pre-bridge more than with usual setups, which is a little easier/faster in my opinion. The setup starting from the standing position (at the sign) is always the same, which makes it easy to remember and use.

Features of this map:
The map shows all Front and Back variations of my setup, including straight nodes. The Obby/Anchor positions are represented by wool, and if an Anchor position can break the Crystal, it is marked in red (None of the beds can).

Pls dm me any feedback you may have on Discord (Klyx#1848)!

Making those setups was made possible thanks to Twagz, AstraF, Nayoar and Crookst.
